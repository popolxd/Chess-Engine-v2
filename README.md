Search:
- minimax seach
- capture search
- alpha beta pruning
- very basic move ordering
- depth: 5 at the beginning, 8 at the most

Evaluation:
- counting up all the material
- piece square tables (pawn and king have extra one for endgame)


Todo:
- optimize getting L moves from PL moves
- change minimax to negamax
- more efficient move ordering
- better move ordering
- better evaluation code (it is terrible to read)
- better evaluation
- gui
- transposition table

New ideas:

Maybe todo:
- 50 move rule
- promotion to different piece than queen
- repetition rule
- get rid of boolean parameters to function
